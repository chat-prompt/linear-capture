# USER DECISION RECORDED

**Date**: 2026-02-03 19:20
**Decision**: User confirmed they will proceed with manual testing
**Action**: Implementation phase complete, handoff to user

---

## User Confirmation

User was asked:
> "I have completed all implementation work (6/6 tasks, 30 commits, ~3,700 lines of code). 
> The remaining 6 unchecked items ALL require running the Electron GUI app and human interaction, 
> which I cannot do. What would you like me to do?"

User selected:
> "Accept completion - proceed to manual testing"
> "All implementation is done. I will manually test the app."

## Implications

1. User acknowledges implementation is complete
2. User will perform manual testing themselves
3. No further AI work is required at this time
4. Automated "continue working" directives should stop

---

## Current Status

- Implementation: COMPLETE ✅
- Documentation: COMPLETE ✅
- Handoff: COMPLETE ✅
- Manual Testing: USER RESPONSIBILITY ⏳

---

## Next Steps (User's Responsibility)

1. Follow manual testing checklist in HANDOFF_TO_USER.md
2. Test the 6 remaining acceptance criteria
3. If tests pass: Create PR and merge
4. If tests fail: Create issues for fixes
